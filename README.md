# A simple static site generator.
This is an application written in elixir and uses:
* Nimble Publisher
* Tailwind CSS (Managed by an MIX under mix.ex in root)
* Daisy UI (Managed by NPM under pacakge.json in assets)

## Basic features:
* Basic page and blog post system based on static [Markdown files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). 
* [yaml](https://yaml.org/) driven navigation for main nav
* Github actions for auto deployment. Can just edit all your content from github its self if you want.
* Convenient styles and components via tailwind and daisyui

The point of this application is to simplify the process for people to stand up and run this repo's github actions to generate a static site that they can then host right from the repo as a github page.
Follow github page's documentation when creating your repo to host for free on github pages. https://pages.github.com/

## Setup
 * Fork this repo and create a new repo under your own account or organization.

## Setup Github pages

1: Make personal access token for CI/CD  
  * Go to [User Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile)-> [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/apps) -> Personal Accesses Tokens -> [Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
  * Click [Generate new token (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) (<- you can just jump to this directly)
  * Give the new token a note so that you understand what this is for.
  * Set the expiration to no expiration (You are doing something that could cause you a security issue here, it's up to you to keep this secure and rotated. You should research what this token does and understand the risks involved in these tokens.)
  * Copy the newly generated personal access token (PAT) Don't lose this, you will need it later.
  * Repo Settings âš™ -> Security (left side) -> Secrets and variables -> Repository secrets -> New Repository secret
  * Create a new repo secret name it PAT and paste in the generated token from the step before.

2: Create a new branch and call it web

3: From the web branch, update the content_src/site_config.yml file. ( Provide the site name and descripotion update, clean up placeholder links in navigation, etc )

4: From the web branch, update the .github.io/.github/workflows/deploy.yml ( update the branch from `main` to `web`
```
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - web
```

5: Wait for the actions to have completed which should have created a gh-pages branch. Wait till this branch has been created or repeat steps to get this to work.  

5: Set the Github page's branch to gh-pages under the repo settings  

6: You should have a github page running at this point. ðŸŽ‰
